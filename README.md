# german-verb-conjuations-api
My german verb conjugations api

I built this this mock REST API out of the lack of available free data for German verbs, which I need for the German verb conjugation game I`m  working on.

This project follows along with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4"> Make your own mock API </a> tutorial by Code with Ania Kub√≥w. I adapted the data to my needs. 

You can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc requests to it. 

### Built with
- <a href="https://github.com/typicode/json-server"> json-server package</a>, which allows us to create a full mock "REST API" with zero coding in less than 30 seconds.
